## Description

This Python script tracks guest entries using a user ID system. It prompts users to enter their user ID, records the entry time, and saves the information to a text file. The user ID is associated with a specific guest name.

## Features

- Supports multiple guests with unique user IDs.
- Records guest name, user ID, and entry time.
- Uses a simple text file for data storage.

## Usage

1. Run the script (guest_log_book).
2. Enter your user ID when prompted.
3. The script will check if the user ID is in the guest list.
4. If valid, it records the entry time along with the guest name and user ID.
5. The guest book information is displayed, including a horizontal line divider.
6. Repeat the process or enter 'quit' to end the program.

## Guest List Configuration

Edit the `guest_list` dictionary in the script to add or remove guest user IDs and names.

```python
guest_list = {'001': 'Mike', '002': 'Bob', '003': 'Ruth', ...}
